### About

This is a simple frontend application that speaks to a third part API. When logged in you will go to a simple search page where you can search for different stores that will give you different cashbacks.

# Almost no styling done :)

# TODO:

- Clean the code base
- Implement TypeScript
- Style to perfection
- Look for effective ways handling the API calls
